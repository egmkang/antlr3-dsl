this is a DSL like protocol buffer to generate codes, now only has cpp implementation.
support type:
int8, int16, int32, int64, string, and user defined struct.
for example(item.txt):
struct Item
{
  int8 ItemType,
  int32 ItemID,
  string name[128],
}

and compile it like this:
./message item.txt

now you can get two files: name.h and name.cpp.
detail sample in $ROOT/bin.
enjoy it
